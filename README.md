# Week-3-COVID-19-Data-Analysis 
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 dataset to understand global, continent-level, and country-level trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, time-series trend analysis, and extracting meaningful insights based on the provided dataset (Data Science – Week 3.pdf).
Objectives
Clean and preprocess the COVID-19 dataset
Handle missing values, incorrect types, and anomalies
Analyze daily, weekly, and cumulative case trends
Visualize top affected countries and global patterns
Evaluate death rates, case spikes, and continent-wise trends
Derive insights supported by visual evidence
Dataset Description
The dataset contains fields such as date, location, continent, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population, and possibly total_recovered.
These fields are used to compare cases, deaths, and trends across countries and continents.
Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualizations
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
GitHub for version control
Steps Performed
Cleaned data (handled NaNs, corrected inconsistent values, removed duplicates)
Performed descriptive statistical analysis
Generated time-series plots for weekly new cases
Compared top countries by total cases
Visualized continent-wise rolling averages
Calculated metrics like death rate (%)
Summarized findings into key insights
Key Insights
Multiple global waves were visible due to variants and reporting cycles
Top 10 countries by total cases were mainly large-population or high-testing countries
India’s trend showed clear major spikes across different phases
Death rate comparisons revealed countries with higher fatality percentages due to limited testing or overwhelmed healthcare

Continent-level patterns highlighted Europe, Asia, and the Americas as major contributors to global spikes
